//If you want to define the type of a particular variable we can use the typeof operator.

var x = 5; 
var y = "5";
console.log(typeof x); //this is a number
console.log(typeof y); // this is a string

//There is another typeof operator named instanceof.
//This operator is basically used when we want to compare the type of objects
