		/**
		The window object is supported by all browsers. It represents the browser's window.

		All global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.

		Global variables are properties of the window object.

		Global functions are methods of the window object.

		Even the document object (of the HTML DOM) is a property of the window object:

			window.document.getElementById("header");
		
		is the same as:

			document.getElementById("header");

		 * Java script has a window object which represents an open window (current open window)
		 * Everything you declare inside the current window is created as a property of the window object.
		 * 		window.testVariable
		 * 		window.testFunction
		 * 
		 * We can access the window object and get things done.
